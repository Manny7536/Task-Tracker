# Task-Tracker
This is a CLI app to track your task and manage your to-do list.
Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this project, I have build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. In this project I have implemented my programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.
